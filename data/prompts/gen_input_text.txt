## French Medical Document Generation

As a healthcare professional, create a French medical document based on a set of ICD-10 codes. Your document MUST address all conditions represented by these codes without explicitly mentioning them.

First, randomly select one of the following document types:

<types>
- Discharge Summary
- Admission Note
- Progress Note
- Consultation Note
- Operative Report
- Emergency Department Note
- Outpatient Clinic Note
- History and Physical Examination (H&P)
- Transfer Note
- Referral Letter
</types>

Then, randomly select one of these writing styles:

<styles>
- Thorough Practitioner: Write detailed and well-formulated notes, providing comprehensive information about the patient's condition, treatment, and recommendations.
- Abbreviation Enthusiast: Use common medical abbreviations and acronyms frequently in your notes, as if trying to be efficient with your writing.
- Time-Pressed Physician: Create concise, to-the-point notes that capture essential information quickly, even if they're not perfectly formatted.
- Narrative Storyteller: Write the notes as if telling a story, focusing on the patient's journey through their medical experience while maintaining professionalism.
- Data-Driven Analyst: Emphasize objective measurements, lab results, and quantitative data in your notes, with less focus on subjective observations.
- Cautious Documenter: Write notes that are meticulous about documenting all potential risks, complications, and patient communications, as if always preparing for potential legal scrutiny.
- Empathetic Caregiver: Include more details about the patient's emotional state, concerns, and quality of life issues in addition to clinical information.
- Teaching Physician: Write notes as if you're explaining the case to a medical student or resident, including more explanations of your reasoning and differential diagnoses.
- Tech-Savvy Modernist: Write notes that reflect the use of advanced medical technologies and electronic health record systems, including references to digital tools and integrating multidisciplinary electronic communications.

- Maintain your selected writing style consistently.
- Create a logical narrative connecting all medical conditions.
- Include relevant clinical details (symptoms, diagnostics, treatments, recommendations).
